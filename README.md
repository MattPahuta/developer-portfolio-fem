## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [Coder Coder](https://www.example.com) - Part way into my development of this project, I found Jessica Chan's video walkthrough on YouTube. I made quite a few different choices as what Jessica went with, but her video walkthrough of the project is immensely useful for those learning more advanced CSS and for getting a sense of how an experienced developer would tackle a project like this. Also, I ran into the same scroll bar issues related to the absolutely positioned svg decorative elements. Watching her troubleshoot the problem was immensely helpful and I ended up changing my fix to better resemble what she came up with. In general, dealing with these svg images was a incredably frustrating. I'm glad I'm not the only one who struggled with getting them to work in a reasonable manner.
- [ModernCSS](https://moderncss.dev/css-button-styling-guide/) - Stephanie Eckles's button styling guid is something I keep coming back to over and over again. This project was no different.
- [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell/featured) - I began tackling the header/hero layout in a similar way Jessica approached the issue, using absolutely positioned elements. Then, I remembered a YouTube short by Kevin Powell where he talked about stacking content with grid. I didn't find the specific short (but I'm sure its in his channel somewhere) but luckily I made a note about his approach and was able to use it here. I don't know if this is necessarily more efficient or easier to understand than positioning the elements absolutely, but here it is.

## Acknowledgments

This is where you can give a hat tip to anyone who helped you out on this project. Perhaps you worked in a team or got some inspiration from someone else's solution. This is the perfect place to give them some credit.

As mentioned above, part way along my development of this project I reviewed Jessica Chan's approach to the challenge. I want to call out several areas of the code I ended up revising based on the approach Jessica took, Including my somewhat clumsy implementation of the uderline text-decoration of the hero accent text in favor of her background-image w/linear-gradient solution. However, for the links with similar accent styles, I went with something closer to Stephanie Eckles' approach to styling links as buttons.
